            <p>During the last weekend of October I attended LAUNCH.ed's 3 Day Startup event
              at the Holyrood Outreach center.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">3 Day Startup’s mission is to activate entrepreneurial potential in students of all kinds through experiential education and a global entrepreneurship ecosystem.
            </blockquote>

            <p>It brought together 60 students from many backgrounds to work on interdisciplinary projects
              proposed by the attendees. We selected the best ideas, built the concept for a startup and then
              explored competition and consumer interest.
            </p>
            <p>Once we had that, we built a business model and some prototypes,
              to later pitch the concept to judges at the end of the weekend.</p>


            <p>It was a tremendously fast-paced and useful event, during which I learned some of the challenges
              involved in running a startup through hands on experience and the advice and challenges of mentors and
              experts.</p>

            <p>This is my experience during the program!</p>



            <h2 class="section-heading">Day One: Team Forming</h2>


            </br>
            <p><b>Idea generation</b></p>
            <p>The LAUNCH.Ed team gave a brief introduction, and we were quickly split into random groups.
              We were sent to a meeting room, told to pitch ideas to each other and then choose our
              favourite two. There were some really interesting ideas: an “Uber for printing”, a blog to
              promote cruelty free products…</p>
            <p>We landed on two ideas - a safety wearable for skiers, and
              the idea I pitched - a platform where users could submit and download audioguides and
              walking tours around cities.</p>
            </br>
            <p><b>The elevator pitch</b></p>
            <p>Each person that proposed their idea and had it selected pitched it to the whole audience
              for a minute, and 8 were chosen. My idea was that users could submit walking tours with
              audioguides around cities, for like $1 a download. As a platform, we’d take a percentage
              for every download, and that’s how we’d generate revenue.
            </p>
            <p>We all voted for our favourite idea, the top 8 were selected as the final startups - and
              mine was chosen! SmarTrips was born, and I was team leader for the weekend. People
              approached the team leaders and asked about the weekend plans, they gave us a meeting room
              and we started planning!</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Day Two: Our Lean Startup</h2>

            <p>We came in, had an info session about the customer discovery process,
              and had a few minutes to plan our strategy. We then split into pairs and ran out to
              the street to meet our customers! </p>

            <p>Edinburgh is a really touristy city, and so finding potential customers was easy.
              I quickly learned that:
              <ul>
                <li>people either plan their trips very carefully, or do not plan at all.</li>
                <li>tourists enjoy taking a bus tour on the first day to get a sense of what’s around.</li>
                <li>never underestimate a physical guide book!</li>
              </ul>
              </br>
              <p><b>The lightning round</b></p>
              <p>When we got back to the venue, we had lunch straight away, and then - the lightning round!
                I went back to my team’s meeting room, and we all worked on our startup for an hour following the lean canvas.
              </p>
              <p>Every fifteen minutes, a new pair of mentors would come in, listen to our pitch, give us feedback and challenge
                our ideas with their experience and knowledge.

                This helped us mould the original idea into a startup, and simplify it so we could communicate our idea in a five minute pitch.</p>

              <p>In retrospect, this is where I take the most from - all mentors provided really valuable advice, but not
                everyone had the same ideas. I took each mentor’s advice too literally, and that made me loose focus on the original idea.
                I learned that I should take the best out of every piece of feedback, but not get distracted from the core mission or change
                it drastically every fifteen minutes!</p>
            </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Pitching <b>SmarTrips</b> at the end of Day 2</span>

            <p><b>Pitch perfect</b></p>

            <p>After the lightning round, we had time to prepare our second pitch. We had five minutes to explain our plan, and then five
              minutes to answer questions. During the afternoon, I had split the team into smaller groups, focused on key areas: go to
              market strategy, user interface and experience and customer segmentation.</p>

            <p>We didn’t have much time, so I gave each focus team one minute of the pitch, and then structured the presentation. it went
              really well! We kept it focused and simple, and finished in under four minutes.</p>


            <p>We took note of the issues raised during the Q&A, so we could perfect the pitch on day three. These were:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Day Three: The Final Pitch</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
              touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
